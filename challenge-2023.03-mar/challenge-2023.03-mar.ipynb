Remember that you need an account on qBraid and send us a DM to share the credits and to use a real QPU. You can consider and try to contribute to an important part of the quantum community working in the field of quantum noise and error mitigation 😊"

If you want to know more about the Unitary Fund you will see their [discord channel](http://discord.unitary.fund/) 🎉🎉🎉 "
