    "# February 2023 Challenge: Mentorship Program Screening Tasks\n",
    "\n",
    "Since this month coincides with the application window for the QOSF mentorship program, we have decided to make the corresponding screening tasks the challenge for this month. So, even if you aren't applying to the mentorship program you can still have a look at the screening tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are four separate tasks, so you're welcome to try your hand at as many of them as you like!\n",
    "\n",
    "**_NOTE: The application deadline is February 28th, so don't submit any PRs until after that date since you would be making potential solutions public.**\n",

    "## Task 1 Find the largest number\n",
    "\n",
    "You have two integers, either positive or negative, and the challenge is to generate a quantum algorithm that returns which is the larger number. Consider an appropriate number of qubits and explain why your proposal is valid for all kinds of numbers in case \n",
